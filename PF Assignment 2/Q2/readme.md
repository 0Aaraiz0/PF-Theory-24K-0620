For this problem, I began by analyzing the requirements and breaking down the task into smaller steps. I used a structured approach, focusing on 
understanding the constraints and edge cases. I implemented a solution by iterating through each step logically, testing and adjusting where necessary 
to meet all specifications. To ensure accuracy, I validated my solution with sample inputs and outputs.

What I Learned:

Through this problem, I strengthened my understanding of strings and arrays.
Additionally, I gained more confidence in tackling similar challenges, especially in terms of analyzing requirements and debugging effectively.
